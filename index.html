      <h1 id="intro">It's Nice To Make Your Acquaintance</h1>
      <p>My name is David Moates. I am 29 years old married to Anna, and we have one child, Oliver. I was born outside of Atlanta, GA but lived most my life in the Memphis, TN area. I like to think of myself as a hard and efficient worker. I enjoy learning new things and not afraid of taking on new tasks where I would need research to figure out how to solve it. I am a self-starter, and cannot stand around. I need to be doing something. I learned at a young age that if you have time to lean your have time to clean.</p>

      <h1 id="skills">Things I can do</h1>
      <p>It would be fun to say that one of my "skills" is fight Ninjas or I can shot an arrow throw a lifesaver candy. I do not have fun and cool skills like that at all, but I can do a kickflip on a skateboard.
      <p>Some important skills I do have are knowledge of Adobe CC. I know Illustrator and Photoshop very well, and I am fimilar with InDesign, Premiere, and After Effects. I can also work on either macOS or Windows with easy. Linux is a learning curve, but I am comfortable using it. I have worked with both Tricaster and Blackmagic Switchers. I can work most cameras and soundboards with experience in a live setting. I also know how to wrap a cable correctly (this is for the people who know). I did have a short podcast about sports with a friend were I did most of the audio editing. As I am current student of Lambda, I have learned HTML and CSS. I will learn JavaScript, Python, Less, as well as other language. I want it know that I do enjoy learning new skills and can wear many hats.</p>

    <!-- Work History Section -->
    <section class="work">
      <h1 id="work">The History of my Labor</h1>
      <p>I am currently working at a branch of Momentum Group, Eykon. We sell and distribute wallcovering and upholstery products. With the job title of Order Picker, my job mostly consist of shipping and receiving samples as well as product. We have to meet strict deadline. That being said Efficiency and Organization are the most important skills I have to get the job done.</p>
      <p>I worked at 2 different sign shops where I was the Graphic Design and Installer. These jobs were the most stressful because of the deadline that were need to be met. I was able to work on Vehicle Wrap, Building Signage, Wall Wraps, Decals of all sizes, and warehouse signage. Efficiency and Organization were very importnat as well as keeping a clean work environment. I mostly work in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.</p>
      <p>Gospel Broadcasting Network (GBN) is one of my favorite places I have worked. My offical title was Volunteer Coordinator, yet at GBN we wore many hats. I mostly head up getting volunteer to help with different tasks like mail outs, camera work, etc. I also did camera work, studio set building, setting up the cameras by running cables, etc. With this company you learn how to do everything. I also got experience working on live show. I worked a debate in front of a live audience. I still   have a great relationship with GBN to this day. I had to use the full Adobe CC as well.</p>
      <h3>Volunteer Experience</h3>
      <p>At Southaven church of Christ, I help run the equipment, schedule, and train people for the Audio/Video room. I also help teach different classes on Sundays and Wednesdays, and cut the grass from time to time.</p>
      <p>I have volunteer to be a Counselor for Sardis Lake Christian Camp Session 2. I work with children ages 7-18. It is a week away from home for the children as well as the counselors. We play sports, have devotions, and just fun for the whole week. The counselors are considered the children's parents for that time. It is always a fun and rewarding week.</p>
      <p>My Brother-in-law (Kyle Taubken) is a filmmaker. He has graciously let me help him on his short films by running sound. So far I have worked on 4 short.</p>
